# Arcade

This repository hosts the landing page for the Pazneria arcade. The site is available at https://pazneria.github.io/arcade and will link to individual games.

Each game should be developed in its own repository under the Pazneria account. When your game is ready, add a link to it on the `index.html` page in this repository so it appears on the arcade page.

More games coming soon!
